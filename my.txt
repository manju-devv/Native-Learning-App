npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
        react-native-screens
            Purpose:
            Optimizes navigation performance by using native primitives to manage screens.
            Reduces memory usage and improves transitions by "freezing" off-screen components.
            Heavily used in react-navigation to enhance screen mounting/unmounting behavior.
            Use Case:
            When using libraries like @react-navigation/native or @react-navigation/stack, it's used internally to boost performance.
            Especially useful when navigating between many screens, or dealing with complex navigation stacks.
